PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT 4:
- The website will connect to Wheatley, open PA4 and log in for the Save Filters and ratings to work. If not signed up then sign-up and log in with your password. Then you should be able to see the rating slider to rate the car. The ratings will be saved to the database table(ratings). If you filter the page, this will be saved to the database table(user_filter). The theme colour will be saved in the database table(theme) whenever you change the theme colour. When you log in the logout button will appear instead of the sign-up button. The API is also pulled from the one made in Prac3.

- The filters do not run from the previous prac, but the Filter saves to the database. The filter code works perfectly from Prac3 and I did not make any big changes with the JS files, but when I changed it to My API then the filter dropdown does not run well. The code is there.


-Tried to implement a timeout session, where the user will be logged out in 10 minutes.
